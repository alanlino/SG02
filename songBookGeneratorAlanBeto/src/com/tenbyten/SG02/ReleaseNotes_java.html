<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in the custom chord editor that made it impossible to define guitar chords with unplayed 5th or 6th strings.</li>
<li>Removed the transpose option from the options dialog, because it can cause confusion and loss of transpose settings in the songbook/print list.</li>
<li>Transposing &ldquo;All&rdquo; songs will now only transpose the songs in the songbook/print list, and not in the (left side) song list.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fixes and minor changes:<p/>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem reading song files with an empty key signature ({k:}). This caused the song list to display blank, although navigating the list with the keyboard would show the songs one by one.</li>

<div class="minor_version">
<dl>
<dt>
Version 1.9.0; June 2018
</dt>
<dd>
<p>New features in this release:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for the capo directive. Capo can be printed in the title, footer and comments using the %C formatting code.
		Adding a capo directive will affect the key signature of the song displayed by Songsheet Generator.
		For example, with {capo: 2} and {key: D}, the actual concert key of the song is E.
		With capo <strong>turned on</strong> in the preferences, Songsheet Generator will display the song&rsquo;s key as &ldquo;E (Capo 2)&rdquo; in the song list,
		and the chords will be based on D (for playing on guitar with a capo on fret 2).
		With capo <strong>turned off</strong> in the preferences, Songsheet Generator will display this song&rsquo;s key as &ldquo;E&rdquo;
		and the chords will be based on E (for playing on piano, for instance).</li>
	<li>Added support for multiple artist directives.</li>
	<li>Double-clicking a Songsheet Generator Songbook (sgb) file in the Finder will open the songbook (and launch Songsheet Generator, if it is not already running). </li>
	<li>Added support for the <a href="https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/Directives-meta.html">ChordPro.org meta directive.</a> This works exactly like the Songsheet Generator data directive.
		The <a href="https://www.chordpro.org/chordpro/ChordPro-Configuration-Format-Strings.html">ChordPro.org meta formatting codes</a> are not yet supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes and minor changes:<p/>
<ul>
	<li>Transposing by half-steps is a little bit smarter about the actual key signature (as regards sharps and flats).</li>
	<li>Songs with multiple key signature transitions are now shown with an arrow instead of a comma: <b>C&#8594;D</b>.</li>
	<li>Improved the readability of the &ldquo;Display on Monitor&rdquo; (now: &ldquo;Screen&rdquo;) menu.</li>
	<li>Fixed an application freeze that could happen when going backwards in the Full Screen Presentation.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that would cause some songs with lines that contained only chords and spaces to stop displaying.</li>
	<li>Improved the reliability of saving custom chord definitions.</li>
	<li>Improved the friendliness of saving a modified songbook when opening a different songbook or quitting.</li>
	<li>Added an informational message when not all of the songs in a newly-opened songbook can be found in the song list.</li>
	<li>Fixed the indicator of an edited songbook; the circular red close button in the title bar will now contain a dot.</li>
	<li>The file name of the open songbook is now displayed before &ldquo;Songsheet Generator&rdquo; in the window title bar (instead of within brackets, at the end).</li>
	<li>Songs with identical names are sorted alphabetically by artist.</li>
	<li>Updated the embedded Java runtime in the macOS app to the latest version.</li>

<dt>
Version 1.8.0; March 2017
</dt>
<dd>
<p>New features in this release:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Improved the songs and print lists: 
		Artist and key signature are displayed in new columns in the songs list, 
		and key signature or transposed interval are displayed in a separate column in the print list.
		Clicking on a column header in the songs list will sort the songs by title, key, or artist.</li>
	<li>The Java runtime is now embedded within the app bundle on Mac OS X.
		It is no longer necessary to install Java runtime software separately from Songsheet Generator.</li>
	<li>For improved security on Mac OS X, Songsheet Generator is signed with the Ten by Ten Mac Developer ID Certificate.</li>
	<li>Cleaned up the included songs and edited the author, copyright, and key signature.</li>

</dt>
<dd>
<p>New features in this release:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Footer control codes may now be used in comments ({c:}) and instrumental comments ({gc:}). Any footer formatting control codes may be used in comments, except for the justification codes (%l %c %r) which are ignored.
	This allows data values to be defined in the song, and printed within the song. The current key signature may also be printed in a comment using the %k format code. (As with footers, use %% to print a percent sign.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes and minor changes:
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem where two Preferences dialogs would appear when running  Oracle&rsquo;s Java, and the shortcut key &#8984;, was used to access the Preferences.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<h2>Songsheet Generator 1.5</h2>

<div class="minor_version">

Version 1.5.2; August 2010

<dd>
<p>Fixes and minor changes:
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem with in-song chord definitions that appeared in version 1.5.1.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>


<div class="minor_version">
<dl>
<dt>
Version 1.5.1; April 2010
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fixes and minor changes:
<ul>
<li>The embedded HTML style &quot;Chorus overall&quot; setting is now saved properly.</li>
<li>Shorthand directives such as &quot;c:&quot; and &quot;t:&quot; are matched more
strictly (just as in the Windows version).  
This provides better compatibility with ChordPro songs edited in ChordPro Manager.</li>
<li>Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X 10.2 and 10.3 are no longer supported.</li>
<li>Added support for Page Up and Page Down keys in full screen view.</li>
<li>Fixed the automatic update download so that it would actually open the download link.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<div class="minor_version">
<dl>
<dt>
Version 1.5.0; July 2009
</dt>
<dd>
<p>New features in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printer margins and tabs can now be set in either metric (mm) or imperial
(inch) units.</li>
<li>Multi-monitor support has been added to the program.
On the Full Screen Options Page, it is now possible to select the desired
monitor from a list of connected displays.</li>
<li>Added Rich Text (RTF) output.  
RTF will retain the font settings and colors from the printed output, as well
as margins and column settings.  Hyphenation is not supported, and line breaks
may not match the printed output.  
<br><em>Please note</em> that RTF is a document exchange format, and does not
guarantee specific typesetting.  The appearance of the RTF depends on the
software displaying it, and many programs ignore much of the RTF formatting
(these programs include WordPad on Windows; and TextEdit, Pages, and QuickLook
on the Mac).  For best results, view the RTF in Microsoft Word or
OpenOffice.</li>
<li>Songsheet Generator now supports multiple key signatures in a file.  When
more than one {key: } directive is detected in the song, all the keys will be
shown next to the song title in the print list.  The &quot;Transpose to
Key&quot; menu will indicate transposition of the main (first) key; all the
keys will be transposed relative to the transposition that is applied to the
main key.</li>
<li>Multiple key signatures can be addressed in the footer using a to adding a
dash followed by the key number in the song to the usual key directive (%k).
For example: %k-1 is the first key in the song (and produces the same
result as %k); %k-2 produces the second key in the song; and so on.</li>
<li>Added a control to quickly pick the output destination on the main dialog.
This has the same function as the list of output destinations found in the 
Options Menu, but is easier to find.</li>
<li>By default, the table of contents will now print on its own physical page.
A checkbox on the General Options page will return Songsheet Generator to its
old behavior, where there was merely some space between the TOC and the first
song.</li>
<li>Added a &quot;Reveal Songs in Finder&quot; menu command on the Mac.  This
command will open a new Finder window displaying the contents of the songs
folder.</li>
<li>For registered users, Songsheet Generator will automatically check the Ten
by Ten website for updates to the software (automatic checking can be disabled,
if you prefer).</li>
</ul>

<p>Fixes and minor changes:
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem that would cause song scanning to stop when an unexpected
file was encountered.</li>
<li>Fixed the small chord spacing problem caused by hyphenation of lyrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>User interface improvements:
<ul>
<li>The list and mini-preview panes on the main dialog are now resizable.</li>
<li>The &quot;usage&quot; column in the data key/value editor now shows the
format that should be used to produce the data value in the footer.
(Previously, this column showed how to define the key and value in a song; but
that was not very useful, since the value was already defined in the editor!)</li>
<li>Changed the &quot;Songs to Print&quot; List label to indicate that the
list is equivalent to the contents of the current Songbook.</li>
<li>Eliminated the &quot;show mini-preview&quot; option and checkbox.</li>
<li>Eliminated the &quot;double-click-to-remove&quot; 
behavior of the &quot;Songs to Print&quot; List.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Songsheet Generator 1.4</h2>

<div class="minor_version">
<dl>
<dt>
Version 1.4.1; October 2008
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fixes and minor changes:
<ul>
<li>Save as ChordPro output will now transpose the key correctly.</li> 
<li>Fixed incorrect alignment when using a Unicode right single quotation mark character (&#8217;; &amp;#8217; \u2019; UTF-8: (e2, 80, 99)).</li>
<li>Fixed bad performance when wrapping lines of chords without lyrics.</li>
<li>Clarified the exclusivity of guitar and ukulele mode by changing the
checkbox to a pair of radio buttons.</li> 
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<div class="minor_version">
<dl>
<dt>
Version 1.4.0; May 2008
</dt>
<dd>
<p>New features in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a Ukulele mode; this will cause chord grids to appear with only four
strings.  Since there are several tuning options for Ukulele, there are no
built-in chords; please use the chord editor to define your chords.  It is
possible to freely switch back and forth between the normal six-sting and
four-string modes, but all songs will print in the current mode; i.e. there is
no way to identify a song as a Ukulele- or six-string-only song.</li>
<li>Added a global data key/value editor.  Key/value pairs defined in this
editor will be applied to all songs.  By using a global value, it is possible
to define rarely-changing global text such as an organization name or other
identifying information.  The editor shows the text that must be entered in the
song file to make use of the data key/value pair that has been defined.</li>
<li>Added a &quot;New Song File&quot; command in the File menu.  This will
create a new file in the songs folder, fill it with a simple ChordPro template,
and open the text editor.  </li>
<li>Added a preference to start each song on a new physical page, regardless
of the page layout style.  A checkbox to control this has been added to the
Print Options page.  
(ChordPro note: this has the same function as putting a <code>{npp}</code> at the top of every song.)</li>
<li>Added a "Save to ChordPro" output option.  This function allows songs to
be exported with their chords transposed in ChordPro, or without their chords.  
In effect, the songs will be exported with ChordPro directives that match the print settings.
Please note that the ChordPro syntax may differ slightly from the syntax in the original song.
Data values and chord definitions will be retained, but their ordering may be different from the original file.
This function uses abbreviated ChordPro directives (e.g. &quot;t:&quot; for &quot;title:&quot;).
Please do not use this function to overwrite your original songs&mdash;it may result in data loss!
(Songsheet Generator does try to prevent you from doing this.)
<br><em>Note:</em> If multiple songs are selected into the &quot;Songs to Print&quot; list, they will all
be saved to a single file, with <code>{ns}</code> directives between them.  
<br><em>Also Note:</em> If you attempt to bring one of these multiple-songs-per-file
files back into Songsheet Generator, only the first song title will appear in the songs list.
</li>
<li>Lines of chords without lyrics will be wrapped if they exceed the margin,
just as normal lines are wrapped.</li>
<li>Song titles may optionally be wrapped, instead of reduced, to fit in a single
line.  A checkbox to control this has been added to the Print Options page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fixes and minor changes:
<ul>
<li>The current songbook is now marked as modified when changes are made by
using the context menu in the print list.</li> 
<li>Text files will export as UTF-8 according to the setting in the General Options page.</li>

Version 1.2.0; May 2007
</dt>
<dd>
<p>New features in this release (there are many!):</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Mac OS X version is now distributed as a nicer-looking disk image,
	with a (hopefully) helpful background image containing installation instructions.
	If you wish to use the sample songs contained on the image,
	drag the "Songs" folder into your Documents folder.</li>
	<li>On Mac OS X, Songsheet Generator will first be set to look in a "Songs" 
	folder inside the Documents folder in your home directory, if this folder exists.</li>
	<li>Songsheet Generator will now remember the most recently used locations
	for saving HTML &amp; text files and songbooks, and for importing.</li>
	<li>Added a thick line chorus marking style.</li>

	<li>Added a <em>Rescan Songs</em> menu item (it&rsquo;s in the File menu).</li>
	<li>Rescanning songs will now attempt to keep the contents of the print list intact (if the filenames are the same).</li>
	<li>Added key signature directive. </li>
	<li>Added <i>Transpose To Key</i> menu.  
	If the key has been defined for a song, the right-click popup menu in
	the Print List will display a list of target key signatures (major or
	minor keys will be shown, as appropriate). </li>
	<li>If the key signature has been defined for a song, it will show up
	in brackets before the song title in the Print List.</li>
	<li>Moved chord and grid options to a dedicated property page in the
	options dialog. </li>
	<li>Grids may be limited to only appear only for &quot;friendly&quot; key
	signatures.  (This will take effect only for songs where the key
	signature has been defined.)  </li>
	<li>Added support for generic data key/value directives in the song file.  
		Keys and their values are noted like this: 
		<code>{d_<i>abc</i>: <i>xyz</i>}</code> where <i>abc</i> is the key and <i>xyz</i> is the value.
		This feature can be used for defining tags such as CCLI number, author, etc.
	</li>
	<li>Added per-song footer format override support. </li>
	<li>Added new footer codes for printing key, page numbering with a
	song, subtitles, and defined data keys/values.  </li>
	<li>Added conditional footer formatting, via the <code>%?</code> and <code>%?!</code> value query codes.</li>
	<li>Added support for footer wrapping.</li>
	<li>Added support for manual line breaks in the footer (put &lsquo;\n&rsquo; in the
	footer text). </li>
	<li>The title and subtitle lines may now be flexibly formatted via the registry.  
	These lines use the same formatting strings as the footer.  The default
	title format string is <code>%c%t</code>, and the default subtitle
	format string is <code>%c%s</code>; these mimic the classic Songsheet
	Generator format.  To get left-justified titles, change them to
	<code>%l%t</code> and <code>%l%s</code>.  Data keys can also be used,
	to insert song data.  There are lots of ways to customize the
	output...!  </li>
	<li>Added a separate font setting for guitar/intstrumental comments.</li>
	<li>Made the import more permissive of extra characters in the chord line.</li>
	<li>Further extended the ChordPro chord definition syntax to support
	defining chords that apply only to a given key signature.  When defined
	this way, chords will revert to the standard definition when the song
	is transposed (or, to another chord defined for the transposed-to key
	signature).  This is optional; when the &quot;key&quot; keyword is not
	added to the chord definition, the chord definition will apply to all
	keys.  The complete chord definition syntax recognized by Songsheet
	Generator is:
	  <div class="inlineindent"><code>{define: &lt;chord&gt; base-fret &lt;base&gt; frets &lt;Low-E&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;G&gt; &lt;D&gt; &lt;A&gt; &lt;E&gt; fingers &lt;Low-E&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;G&gt; &lt;D&gt; &lt;A&gt; &lt;E&gt; key &lt;KEY&gt;}</code></div>
	  <br>For example:
	  <div class="inlineindent"><code>{define: E5 base-fret 7 frets 0 1 3 3 x x fingers - 1 2 3 - - key E}</code></div>
	  <br> All of Songsheet Generator&rsquo;s built-in chord definitions still apply to all keys.</li>

</p>
<p>Fixes and minor changes:
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug that reduced the size of the normal/lyric font when using
	the auto-adjust feature in the Set Fonts dialog. </li>
	<li>The title printed on overflow pages will now use the color of the title font
	(although the rest of the font styling comes from the comment font). </li>
	<li>Clicking left mouse button once and then quickly clicking the right mouse
	button to call up the pop-up menu will no longer register as a double-click. </li>
	<li>Made the thickness of the printed lines (chorus markings and grids) more consistent with the Windows version.</li>
	<li>If a chord is defined within a song, but the song is transposed:
	preference will be given to Songsheet Generator&rsquo;s internal definition
	of the transposed chord, when printing grids.</li>
	<li>Due to a new method for reigstering title and key/value data, it is
	necessary to rescan songs for some song file changes to show up in the
	output.  Songsheet Generator previously re-read the entire song file
	when printing or previewing; this is no longer completely true.</li>
	<li>In previous versions, a value of 0 for transposition would print as
	'0' when %x was defined in the footer.  As of version 1.2.0, nothing
	(not even a blank) will be printed if the transposition value is
	zero.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem with blank lines in guitar tab sections in HTML output.</li>
	<li>Updated the sample song in the documentation.</li>

<p> New features in this release:
<ul>
<li>Improved font control is available through an extended dialog on the Print and Full Screen Options pages.
Please see the online help for further details.
</li>
<li>Tab characters in song files are now expanded to a user-definable space.  Separate spacing values are
available on both the Print and Full Screen Options pages; 
the Print spacing value is based on inches, and the Full Screen spacing value is based on a percentage of the screen.
</li>
<li>Chords can now optionally be shown in Italian Notation (do re mi fa so la ti).  
A checkbox on the General Options page controls this behavior, which performs the change 
to Italian Notation when the songs are printed or displayed.
Please note that ChordPro files should still be entered using C D E F G A B notation; 
Songsheet Generator will not recognize Italian Notation in the ChordPro files.
</li>
<li>Several new chorus marking styles are available, including shaded filled box and tabbed indentation;
to accomodate these choices, the Printer Options page now contains a dropdown menu of chorus marking styles. 
</li>
<li>The Release Notes document can be viewed directly from the Help Menu, as it is now
packaged in the Java jarfile.</li>
<li>On the Macintosh, the online help is now installed locally.  (Pure Java users will still need 
to be connected to the Internet in order to connect to the help on the tenbyten.com web site.)</li>
<li>Registration is now required in order to permanently disable a nag screen that appears from time to time.</li>
<li>This software should run natively on both PPC and Intel Macintosh systems.</li>

<p>Fixes and minor changes:
<ul>
<li>A manually-selected page orientation (portrait or landscape) in the Printer Setup dialog or Print dialog
will now be saved and reflected properly in the subsequent Printer Setup dialog and Print dialog. 
When a different Page Layout is chosen, however, or after visiting the Options dialog,
the orientation will revert to the default for that layout.
The default orientation is landscape for "2 Discrete Cells Per Page,"  and portrait for all other layouts.
</li>
<li>Chords are better aligned in the text output.  Since no hyphenation is used in the text output,
    however, some chords will not align exactly.  
    Further detailed spacing alignment must be performed manually. </li>

<h2>Songsheet Generator 1.0</h2>

<dt>
Version 1.0; December 2004
</dt>
<dd>
<p> New features in this release:
<ul>
<li>Added Full Screen support.  
<br>
This is kind of a big deal, since it was the one feature missing from the Java version.
(So now I am finally calling this version 1.0!)  
OK, Print Preview is still missing... but since Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X gives that for free, there is no plan to add Print Preview.
<br><em>Note:</em>  Because of instability in previous Java releases for Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, 
	full screen mode is only supported when Java 1.4.2 Update 1 installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes and minor changes:

<li>Comment lines preceded by a set of chords with no lyrics and no blank lines will now print correctly.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>
Version 0.9.1.0; July 2004
</dt>
<dd>
<p>  New features in this release:
<ul>
<li>The default behavior of Songsheet Generator has always been to apply all of the Options settings when leaving the Options dialog.
	This can have the undesired effect of resetting transposition and &quot;print chords&quot; settings in the &quot;Songs to print&quot; list &mdash;
	when, for instance, simply a font size is changed.  This behavior is by design, but it was pointed out that it is sometimes less 
	than helpful.  
	So, there is now by default a warning message before the transposition and &quot;print chords&quot; settings are applied;
	and, optionally,  songs in the &quot;Songs to print&quot; list will be unaffected.  
	<br>This warning message can be turned off, to return to the usual SG behavior.
	<br><em>Note:</em> no warning is given when changing these settings via the menu.
</li>
<li>Added Page Numbering!  
	<br>Now it is possible to print a full-featured paper songbook using Songsheet Generator.
	The Table of Contents will reflect the proper page numbers.  
	<br><em>Note:</em> this is not the same as Automatic Song Numbering, a separate feature.
	Both Page Numbering and Automatic Song Numbering can be used at the same time.  Using them both produces
	a hymnbook-like system, where songs have separate numbers from the physical pages that they appear on.
	</li>

<li>Added footer support for Printer<!--, Full Screen--> and HTML output destinations.  
The footer text will appear at the bottom of the physical printed page, at the bottom of the screen, or at the end of the HTML &lt;body&gt;.
Any text can be used, but the following control codes can also be used to format the footer:
		<table class="definition" rules="all">
		<thead>
		<tr><th>Code</th><th>Description</th><th>Example Output</th></tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
		<tr><td><code>%l</code> (lowercase 'L')</td><td>Left-justify text following (printer &amp; full screen only)</td></tr>

<dt>
Version 0.8.1.0; February 2004
</dt>
<dd>
<p>Polishing basic functionality, plus porting ongoing fixes from the Windows version. 
This is still considered Beta software, although almost all of the features from
the Windows version have now been properly implemented.
<p> Changes to the software in this release:
<ul>
  <li>Added the "Other..." choice for the transpose menus.</li>
  <li>Text styles are now properly controlled from the properties file.</li>
  <li>Added support for the ChordPro <code>{new_page}</code> (<code>{np}</code>),
		<code>{new_physical_page}</code> (<code>{npp}</code>), and
		<code>{column_break}</code> (<code>{colb}</code>) directives.
		<br><code>{np}</code> will cause a &quot;cell break&quot; in the Two and Four Discrete Cells per Page printing modes, 
		and a column break in the Two Flowing Columns printing mode.  It will cause a physical page break otherwise.
		<br><code>{npp}</code> will always force a physical page break.
		<br><code>{colb}</code> will force a column break in the Flowing Columns printing modes,
		which amounts to a physical page break in the One Flowing Column printing mode.  
		It has no effect in the Discrete Cells printing modes.
		<br><em>Note:</em>  these directives have no effect in the Text and HTML File output destinations.</li>
  <li> Unicode (UTF-8) chordpro files now will be imported correctly, as long as they have the byte-order mark.
		<br>Valid encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16 (little- or big-endian), and default system text encoding.
		<br>The Text File Output Destination will write with the same encoding as the source file.
		<br>HTML will always be output as UTF-8.
		</li>
	<li>Removed the extra <code>&lt;div class=sg_newsong&gt;</code> tag at the end of the HTML output.</li>
</ul>
  </dd>

<dt>
Version 0.7.0.0; December 2003
</dt>
<dd>
<p>  This is still considered Beta software, although almost all of the features from
the Windows version have now been properly implemented.
<p>  New features in this release:
<ul>
<li>Added the Page Setup command.</li>
<li> HTML output is now writing UTF-8.  Using UTF-8 overcomes the display
      problems that were formerly encountered with various web browsers and
	  language settings.</li>
<li> HTML output adds additional style tags for the song body and the Table
of Contents:
<code>sg_song</code>,  <code>sg_toc</code>, <code>sg_toc_header</code>, <code>sg_toc_contents</code> now allow
	  further control over the appearance of the HTML output.</li>
<li> Added a feature to automatically number the printed songs.  The song 
      numbering is also reflected in the Table of Contents.  A checkbox for
      this feature can be found on the General Options dialog.  The setting
      applies to all of the Output Destinations <!--, except for the Full Screen
	  Presentation-->.  The number is never shown in the Mini-Preview.
	  <br><em>Note:</em>  Automatic Song Numbering is not the same as page
	  numbering (a feature that is not yet supported).</li>
<li> Created this Release Notes document.</li>
  </ul>

	  <p>Fixes and minor changes:

  <ul>
<li> HTML output now validates as HTML 4.01 strict.  Related to this
change, the internal song linking now uses <code>&lt;div class=sg_song id=...&gt;</code>
	instead of <code>&lt;a name=...&gt;</code>.</li>
	  <li> Fixed a printing problem in which the first line of a chorus would not
      receive the full "line" chorus mark, when it had no chords, and SG was
	  set to print chords.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Known problems:

  <ul>
	  <li> Unicode (UTF-8) and multibyte text files may not be imported correctly.
		UTF-16 files should work OK.  A UTF-16 song file, when saving to text, will be output as UTF-16.
		Not a lot of testing has been done with these sorts of files.
		This will remain a problem until further notice.
		<em>Notice: UTF-8 works as noted in 0.8.1.0.</em></li>

		<li>Full-Screen Presentation (from the Windows version) has still not been implemented at all.</li>

		<li>Launching the editor program now works mostly correctly on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X, but maybe not completely.  
		Anyway, if an editor is not properly defined, SG will resort to using the TextEdit application
		(this is the default setting).</li>

	<li>Reworked the About Box to make it consistent with the Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X look-and-feel.
	Thanks to Benjamin Johnson, who helped to clean up the code.</li>
<li> Added the ability to print chord grids.  This feature may be turned
      on and off via a checkbox in the General Options dialog.  The size of
      the grids is automatically varied to fit within the page constraints:
      Songsheet Generator will attempt to fit the largest possible grids 
      onto the fewest possible lines.
	  <br>
      The most commonly used chord grids have been built into the Songsheet 
      Generator executable (see below).  Additional chord grids may be 
      defined in song files, via the standard ChordPro chord grid definition
      syntax:
	  <div class="inlineindent"><code>{define: &lt;chord&gt; base-fret &lt;base&gt; frets &lt;Low-E&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;G&gt; &lt;D&gt; &lt;A&gt; &lt;E&gt;}</code></div>
	  <br>For example:
	  <div class="inlineindent"><code>{define: E5 base-fret 7 frets 0 1 3 3 x x}</code></div>
	  <br>Chords grids defined in songs will override any built-in definitions.
	  <br>
      In addition, an extension to the standard format is recognized by
      Songsheet Generator, which adds fingering support to the grid.
      Fingerings are printed below the chord grids.
      The syntax for the fingering definition follows:
	  <div class="inlineindent"><code>{define: &lt;chord&gt; base-fret &lt;base&gt; frets &lt;Low-E&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;G&gt; &lt;D&gt; &lt;A&gt; &lt;E&gt; fingers &lt;Low-E&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;G&gt; &lt;D&gt; &lt;A&gt; &lt;E&gt;}</code></div>
	  <br>For example:
	  <div class="inlineindent"><code>{define: E5 base-fret 7 frets 0 1 3 3 x x fingers - 1 2 3 - -}</code></div>
	  <br>
      The following chords have been built into Songsheet Generator.  Songs
      using chords noted in this list will benefit automatically from the
      new chord grids feature:
	  <div class="inlineindent">Ab, Ab+, Ab4, Ab7, Ab11, Absus, Absus4, Abdim, Abmaj, Abmaj7,
